                    This happened, indeed, to the train in which Mr. Fogg was travelling. About twelve 
                    o'clock a troop of ten or twelve thousand head of buffalo encumbered the track. 
                    The locomotive, slackening its speed, tried to clear the way with its cow–catcher; 
                    but the mass of animals was too great. The buffaloes marched along with a tranquil 
                    gait, uttering now and then deafening
                    bellowings. There was no use of interrupting them, for, having taken a particular direction, nothing 
                    can moderate and change their course; it is a torrent of living flesh which no dam could contain.

                    The travellers gazed on this curious spectacle from the platforms; but Phileas Fogg, who had the most 
                    reason of all to be in a hurry, remained in his seat,  and waited philosophically until it should 
                    please the buffaloes to get out of the way.<br>
                    Passepartout was furious at the delay they occasioned, and longed to discharge his arsenal of revolvers upon them.

                <p>"What a country!" cried he. "Mere cattle stop the trains, and go by in a procession, just as if they were not impeding 
                    travel! Parbleu! I should like to know if Mr. Fogg foresaw this mishap in his programme! And here's an engineer 
                    who doesn't dare to run the locomotive into this herd of beasts!"</p>
